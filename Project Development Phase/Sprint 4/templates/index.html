          <p>Humans are able to recognize body and sign language easily. This is possible due to the combination
of vision and synaptic interactions that were formed along brain development . In order to replicate
this skill in computers, some problems need to be solved: how to separate objects of interest in
images and which image capture technology and classification techniques are more appropriate,
among others.</p>
<br>
<p>In this project Gesture based Desktop automation ,First the model is trained pre-trained on the
images of different hand gestures, such as showing numbers with fingers as 1, 2, 3, 4. This model
uses the integrated webcam to capture the video frame. The image of the gesture captured in the
video frame is compared with the pretrained model and the gesture is identified. If the gesture
prediction is 1 then images are blurred; 2, image is resized; 3, image is rotated etc.</p>
